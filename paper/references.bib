abstract = {In this paper, we present a survey on the application of recurrent neural networks to the task of statistical language modeling. Although it has been shown that these models obtain good performance on this task, often superior to other state-of-the-art techniques, they suffer from some important drawbacks, including a very long training time and limitations on the number of context words that can be taken into account in practice. Recent extensions to recurrent neural network models have been developed in an attempt to address these drawbacks. This paper gives an overview of the most important extensions. Each technique is described and its performance on statistical language modeling, as described in the existing literature, is discussed. Our structured overview makes it possible to detect the most promising techniques in the field of recurrent neural networks, applied to language modeling, but it also highlights the techniques for which further research is required.}

Data come from a survey of adults in Oakland County, Michigan, conducted during the 1976–77 swine influenza immunization campaign. Information is presented on the results of dialing to sample telephone numbers, the frequency of nonworking numbers within the sample, problems with numbers that were never answered, and precision of sample estimates. In addition, some rough estimates of cost are presented and compared to survey costs reported in other studies. Findings suggest that random digit dialing is an efficient survey method, both in terms of cost in implementation and sampling precision.}",

This does not necessarily mean, however, that additional effort could not reduce nonresponse bias. Theories on nonresponse would suggest the use of different recruiting methods for additional survey effort in order to address nonresponse bias. This study looks at changes in survey estimates as a function of making additional calls under the same protocol and additional calls under a different protocol. Respondents who were interviewed as a result of more than five call attempts were not significantly different on any of the key survey variables than those interviewed with fewer than five calls. Those interviewed under a different survey protocol, however, were different on 5 of 12 measures. Additional interviews under both the same and different protocols contributed to the reduction of total nonresponse error. In sum, the use of multiple protocols for part of the survey effort increased the response rate, changed point estimates, and achieved lower total nonresponse error. Future work is needed on optimizing survey designs that implement multiple survey protocols.}",
